## [Memory transferred between snails, challenging standard theory of how the brain remembers](https://www.statnews.com/2018/05/14/memory-transfer-between-snails-challenges-standard-theory/)
 
 There is a lot of controversy here. Including n old study about worms and how ingestion can transfer a kind of a memory.

## [Why Does the Pandemic Seem to Be Hitting Some Countries Harder Than Others?](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/01/why-does-the-pandemic-seem-to-be-hitting-some-countries-harder-than-others)

So, evidently, as in many cases, it is damn complicated. 

The fact that some countries could have been accustomed to such respiratory illnesses due to how T-cells work is interesting and somewhat sound.

>   But there was a peculiarity in the data: in more than forty per cent of pre-pandemic samples, the researchers found evidence that the new coronavirus was somehow triggering a T-cell response. These T cells were acting as if they’d recognized a virus they had assuredly never before encountered.
    ...
    But researchers at Boston University tried to explore the hypothesis that prior common-cold coronavirus infections might affect the severity of covid-19 by looking at patient outcomes.

## [Write Simply](http://paulgraham.com/simply.html)

> And the further they'll read. Most readers' energy tends to flag part way through an article or essay. If the friction of reading is low enough, more keep going till the end.

I wonder whether a through in intensity makes sense in a place where most people get tired?

> Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also conceal the lack of them. That's why some people write that way, to conceal the fact that they have nothing to say. Whereas writing simply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be obvious to everyone, including you.

So it is also the humble thing to do. 

## [Scenius, or Communal Genius](https://kk.org/thetechnium/scenius-or-comm/)

- Places that intrigued genius often were nondescript places. This filters a lot of wannabes.
- How to create it? You can't.
> The serendipitous ingredients for scenius are hard to control. They depend on the presence of the right early pioneers. A place that is open, but not too open. A buffer that is tolerant of outlaws.  And some flash of excitement to kick off the virtuous circle.  You just can’t order this.
- How to protect it? 
>Try to keep accountants and architects and police and do-gooders away from it. Let it remain inefficient, wasteful, edgy, marginal, in the basement, downtown, in the ‘burbs, in the hotel ballroom, on the fringes, out back, in Camp 4.

## [Artificial Curiosity & Creativity Since 1990-91](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/artificial-curiosity-since-1990.html)

>So C is asking questions through its action sequences, e.g., "what happens if I do this?", and M is learning to answer those questions. Here C is motivated to come up with questions where M does not yet know the answer, and C loses interest in questions with known answers. This was the start of a long series of papers on artificial [[curiosity]] and artificial scientists.

Interesting that this is also pretty prevalent in people. Sometimes one just challenges to drag a conversation into uncharted territory. 

>  In modern GAN terminology, the controller C is called the generator, and the world model M the discriminator.

>   C might learn to focus on those parts of the environment where M can always get high prediction errors due to randomness, or due to computational limitations of M. 
> ... that is, to prevent C from exploiting M too easily, C's reward should be M's learning progress or improvements.

 Here C is being compensated like a teacher. 

 > While previous attempts at explaining humor also focused on the element of surprise,[RAS85] they lacked the essential concept of novel pattern detection measured by compression progress due to learning.[AC06][AC09][AC10] This progress is zero whenever the unexpected is just random white noise, and thus no fun at all.

 This is fun.
