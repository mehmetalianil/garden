# The Soul of a New Machine

I bought this book on a recommendation on an HN commentator. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30184653

The book is actually pretty good at making the times where computing grew exponentially exciting as a soap opera. 

Though it must not be judged with, the book is too cringe in its way talking about women and men and their places in society. It makes reading a bit painful, but I guess it is true to its era, even maybe today.
