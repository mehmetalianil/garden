## Drive by Daniel Pink

The idea that creative occupations require, or at least benefit from, internal motivators is somehow evident now. When one reads the examples on the book they are somehow easy to guess, maybe due to the book being outdated now. (Some design books suffered with this as well.)

BUT, the fact the business framework that these jobs are trying to thrive is outdated resonates a lot. There is a dissonance here and it is productive to address it explicitly.

Schools, companies even families all depend on this outdated notion of motivation. 

## How to motivate for rudimentary tasks?

* Explain why a task is necessary.
* Admit that the task is boring.
* Allow people to do it their way.
* And one can go for conditional rewards.

## How to motivate for creative tasks?

* Give autonomy
* Foster mastery
* Establish a purpose.
* If needed let the rewards be unassociated from the task.


> Money is not a non-issue for the intrinsically motivated. BUT its marginal utility is easily challenged by autonomy, mastery and purpose.
