## Drive by Daniel Pink

The idea that creative occupations require, or at least benefit from, internal motivators is somehow evident now. When one reads the examples on the book they are somehow easy to guess, maybe due to the book being outdated now. (Some design books suffered with this as well.)

BUT, the fact the business framework that these jobs are trying to thrive is outdated resonates a lot. There is a dissonance here and it is productive to address it explicitly.

Schools, companies even families all depend on this outdated notion of motivation.
