Engineering has two interfaces, in general. Humans and nature.

I think that it was relatively easy to solve the interface to nature. Though it is not to be understood, its rules are static. Therefore our way of dealing with nature is static. There is room for growth there, but it is mainly about cost. Unless, we are exposed to a totally new environment, like a new planet. We have the hang of how nature works.

Humans, are dynamic and adaptive. Therefore at first the interface to humans were not a huge deal. They adapted into being able to use these tools. Now, though, disregarding this interface comes at a cost. We need to find where this interface has limitations, and focus there. 

Another thing that should be considered but is not an interface is complexity. Still not so sure how to tackle complexity but to ride on it.
