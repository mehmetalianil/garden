It has been a while that I haven't written here, so here we go.

Often I find myself contemplating deeply on a subject that I observe and wonder about. But I either lack the discipline or the preparedness (as if they are different things) to write that down. This is an experiment of writing that down. 

Thoughts are extremely fleeting, for some reason. I am wondering whether this is due to the fact that I am consuming too much real time information. I feel like in a knowledge pyramid, the lower I am, more of the data I consume is real time. When you rise on top that pyramid, one tends to consume more timeless pieces, and take their time to digest.

I wonder about [[meditations]] of Marcus Aurelius. 

It might be an artifact of not being able to manage time. It requires a specifically crafted time to read uninterrupted and dive into thoughts, right? Does it really pay back to do that?
