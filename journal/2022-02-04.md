## Notes on Rust Meeting Leuven 

Happened at AUSY HQ

### Pizza 
Learned about bullet proofs, a kind of zero knowledge proof. 

> @David, any idea on these?

Met with the speakers and a fellow named Tom Godden https://github.com/tgodden. 
Ppl are out there doing embedded. 

## Presentations
Speakers: 

* Devon Kerkhoeve
* Thibaut Vandervelden https://github.com/thibautvdv
* Reuben de Smet  https://github.com/rubdos

### Intro

Rust is memory safe in design (rather than safe with precautions, I guess. Nice way to show the difference to ppl without any idea. )

Ferroscene is noticed and celebrated. (ASIL D compiler ISO26262)

### C vs Rust

Thibaut has compared C vs Rust implemeting bubble sort on nRF52
Rust wins in speed when a particular bug is accounted for. 

> Rust checks for boundaries in loops. Constraint elimination bug results in the throttling down. 

### Flick.rs

This is a nice demo.  https://flickrs.opencloudedge.be

* Functional encryption:
  data --enc--> Enc(data) --dec--> f(data)

  * Attribute based encryption is a subset of functional enc.

> @David, any idea? The demo was pretty instructive.

* Rust is first class citizen in crypto. I think we should go this way. 

### Sailfish 

* Tokio (I have heard of it but have not used it)
* QT (cpp, others use it a lot.)
* These is a cpp crate , evidently.
* I need to polish my `<Refcell>` and `<Box>`
  
### Discussion

* Elm and yew are packages mentioned. 
* Websockets are loved dearly. Can understand why.
* There is a valve manufacturer in BE which the SW team is using Rust. 
* Servers ActixWeb and Rocket and Axon are mentioned.
* Virtual World ?
* Dalek crypto which is using Rust breaks a lot of world records.
