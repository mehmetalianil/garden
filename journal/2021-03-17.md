Some musings. 

It is interesting that I have lost much of my ability to think uninterrupted by myself. Music doesn't really seem to help, it keeps me in the zone, but also severely impairing the depth of my thoughts. I seem to be too easily distracted, and I don't know whether this plays along well with how contemporary knowledge flows, from the surface, fast, with certain disregard against stating its context. At least that is what Twitter is, and that is where ideas are exchanged. 

It is almost painful not to attend to distractions. As if something tragic is
happening there and I am withheld from staring at it. What kind of an illusion is this?
