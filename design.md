# Design

Shitty redefinitions after reading. 

## Affordance

These are relationships between user and item that implies possible actions. 

Take a design component that interfaces with the user. (Not a diode unless they interact with that.) Then try to guess what kind of interaction is possible with that. Can it be pushed, squeezed, seen through,support things? Those are the possibilities of interaction, keep those in mind, they can become unintended signifiers. 

## Signifiers

These are the traits of a designed item that indicates how it can be utilized through form on an **instinctive** level.  They signify and **affordance**.

# Emotional Design 

The idea of emotional design opened my eyes, to be honest. 
All these concepts couldn't actually let me come up with a design that sticks, somehow fell short. 

Then the book by Don Norman, made it explicit why. It talks about a cognitive hierarchy of some sort. There is the carnal, visceral is the term that used, that associates to beauty, soothing curves and shiny. This experience is the most commonplace among humans. There is the functional, that is cognitively more complex, and this is about design letting people accomplish things. What is functional is more of a cultural thing, therefore it is less universal. This is what went wrong when you cannot accomplish something with a design and feel like a fool. The third rung is purpose (sorry I don't remember the terms). When a design is able to provoke, or can become a symbol of a purpose, then it appeals to a smaller set of people, but it becomes a very strong differentiator. 

I had been focusing on signifiers, affordances, mapping, but all of those are from the middle rung, the functional. 

One must judge how frequently a design will be judged with their functionality before getting into this.

Most Industrial IoT devices are rarely functional through their design. They are merely gateways, sensors, well, sadly.
