# Design

Shitty redefinitions after reading. 

## Affordance

These are relationships between user and item that implies possible actions. 

Take a design component that interfaces with the user. (Not a diode unless they interact with that.) Then try to guess what kind of interaction is possible with that. Can it be pushed, squeezed, seen through,support things? Those are the possibilities of interaction, keep those in mind, they can become unintended signifiers. 

## Signifiers

These are the traits of a designed item that indicates how it can be utilized through form on an **instinctive** level.  They signify and **affordance**.
