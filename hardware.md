# Hardware
## A workflow.
This workflow depends on the resultant product.
The main point to focus is to pinpoint the uncertain. 
The uncertain aspect can be:

- the market, adoption
- the nature, whether it is physically possible

We want to eliminate as much [[uncertainty]] as possible. Information, after all is reduction in uncertainty. 
If the most uncertain element is the market, than we need to go make prototypes and gauge interest from early adopters.
There are supposedly some other ways to reduce uncertainty, like making a kickstarter campaign. But these ways are each limited in their own ways and if they are utilized, it is central to know those limitations. 
If the uncertainty xomes from nature and it is really pricy to eliminate it by trial and error, we model and encroach that uncertainty with mental models.
