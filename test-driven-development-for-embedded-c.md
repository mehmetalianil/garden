# Test Driven Development for Embedded C

The subject is of interest to me, since is both about [[engineering-communication]] and [[knowledge-management]]. The book is about *how* test driven development can be applied to embedded engineering, which due to its nature seems to be a stretch. 

Well, we will see how much of it is, then. 

## Concepts 
### Target Hardware bottleneck

I am wondering whether THWB [is still an issue], with more devboards to spare than ever? Is it oftenwise not enough?

## A Testable C Module 

Some new concepts:
- Single instance module: This module is initiated once and used by only through that instance. A LED driver is a good example. There should be a single instance that governs the LEDs, otherwise things might turn awry. STM32 HAL drivers for hardware peripherals are examples to them. I2C2 is initialized once, and is hardwired to a specific peripheral. 
- Multiple instance module: This module is initializable in different places in the code and each one will be independent entitities. A FIFO buffer module will be as such.
