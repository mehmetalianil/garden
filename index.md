# Garden of MAA

This is my first digital garden to grow.

I am sort of a tool nerd, so I have tried many different things to get this. 

Mainly initiated by the movement incepted by Roam Research, I tried other free alternatives, such as TiddlyWiki, Athens, Obsidian and settled on Foam, since it divides the effort it puts to sustain this to other available and actively maintained projects, **and** it has made publishing these notes exceedingly simpler than its alternatives. Kudos there.

By this, I mean that I am willing to do this in public even that means to make a total fool out of myself. My opinion is that reservance and self consciousness may limit one's ability to function to their fullest. I am trying to break that.

So, here I have some Categories:

- [[hardware]] 
- [[knowledge-management]]
- [[engineering-communication]]
- [[books]]
- [[articles]]
- [[tools]]
- [[ideas]]
- [[quotes]]
- [[coding]]
- [[design]]
- [[machine-learning]]
- [[lessons-learned\1.md]]
