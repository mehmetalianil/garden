# Garden of MAA

This is my first digital garden to grow.

I am sort of a tool nerd, so I have tried many different things to get this. 

Mainly initiated by the movement incepted by Roam Research, I tried other free alternatives, such as TiddlyWiki, Athens, Obsidian and settled on Foam, since it divides the effort it puts to sustain this to other available and actively maintained projects, **and** it has made publishing these notes exceedingly simpler than its alternatives. Kudos there. 

So, here I have some Categories.  
- [[Hardware]] 
- [[Knowledge Management]]
- [[Engineering Communication]]
